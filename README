ti5x is an emulator, running on Android, for the venerable
TI-58/58C/59 family of programmable scientific calculators
which were manufactured by Texas Instruments from the late
1970s.

ti5x does not aim for 100% authenticity--which is not possible,
anyway. In particular, I have not bothered to emulate known
bugs and undocumented features of the originals. But it does
try to maintain some of the feel of using the original product,
albeit running a lot faster.
